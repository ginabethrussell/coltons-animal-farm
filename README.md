**Colton's Farm Animals** is a responsive site using a flexbox grid of nine farm animal photos. Users can click on each image to hear the animal's sound and see an image animation. JavaScript code listens for and identifies the correct animal chosen, selects the appropriate audio file to play, ends any currently playing animal sound file, and animates the image being played.  On smaller screens the layout changes from a 3x3 grid to a column, the animation shrinks instead of enlarging the images, and removes the header videos. This site was created for *Colton Alexander*!
